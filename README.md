Bring your DualSense Controller to life on PC with support for Adaptive Triggers!

Emulate with the following while also getting the functionality of a DualSense Controller:

`Xbox360`

`DualShock 4`

`OFF (for no Emulation, reading only inside app)`


Whether you're using Steam or a different platform, you will be able to use DualSenseX with all games!

# **For Game Devs**

Support your game with DualSense Adaptive Trigger Capabilities With DualSenseX App, find out below how to get it setup, and get your game added within the App for all to see and play!

### **Trigger State**
To get this working with your game, you have 2 methods to communicate with the controller.

First one is UDP Server/Client method through Localhost, Project example can be downloaded [**here**](https://github.com/Paliverse/DualSenseX/raw/main/UDPExample.zip)

Second one is the Text file method described below:

There are a few things this App will look for when reading this text file to apply the triggers:

- `LeftTrigger=`

- `RightTrigger=`

- `VibrateTriggerIntensity=` â €â €â €â €â €â €â €* A value between 0-255  | VibrateTrigger Required to use this *

- `CustomTriggerValueLeftMode=`â €â €â €â €â €* CustomTriggerValue Required to use this *

- `CustomTriggerValueRightMode=`â €â €â €â €* CustomTriggerValue Required to use this *

- `ForceLeftTrigger=` 

- `ForceRightTrigger=` 

---
For the `LeftTrigger=` and `RightTrigger=`, there are 19 different state possibilities that you can set, which are **CASE SENSITIVE**:

- `Normal`
- `CustomTriggerValue`
- `GameCube`
- `Resistance`
- `Bow`
- `Galloping`
- `SemiAutomaticGun`
- `AutomaticGun`
- `Machine`
- `Choppy`
- `VerySoft`
- `Soft`
- `Medium`
- `Hard`
- `VeryHard`
- `Hardest`
- `Rigid`
- `VibrateTriggerPulse`
- `VibrateTrigger`
---
for `ForceLeftTrigger=` and `ForceRightTrigger=`
  * When using CustomTriggerValue there are 7 different values that goes into each parenthesis 0-255
    * Example: ForceLeftTrigger=(0)(0)(0)(0)(0)(0)(0) or ForceRightTrigger=(0)(0)(0)(0)(0)(0)(0)
  
  * When using Resistance, there are 2 different values that goes into each parenthesis.
    * `First: 0-9` `Second: 0-8`
    * Example: ForceLeftTrigger=(0)(0) or ForceRightTrigger=(0)(0)

  * When using Bow, there are 4 different values that goes into each parenthesis.
    * `First: 0-8` `Second: 0-8` `Third: 0-8` `Fourth: 0-8`
    * Example: ForceLeftTrigger=(0)(0)(0)(0) or ForceRightTrigger=(0)(0)(0)(0)

  * When using Galloping, there are 5 different values that goes into each parenthesis.
    * `First: 0-8` `Second: 0-9` `Third: 0-6` `Fourth: 0-7` `Fifth: 0-255 NOT recomended to go over 40`
    * Example: ForceLeftTrigger=(0)(0)(0)(0)(0) or ForceRightTrigger=(0)(0)(0)(0)(0)

  * When using SemiAutomaticGun, there are 4 different values that goes into each parenthesis.
    * `First: 0-7` `Second: 0-8` `Third: 0-8`
    * Example: ForceLeftTrigger=(0)(0)(0) or ForceRightTrigger=(0)(0)(0)

  * When using AutomaticGun, there are 4 different values that goes into each parenthesis.
    * `First: 0-9` `Second: 0-8` `Third: 0-255 NOT recomended to go over 40`
    * Example: ForceLeftTrigger=(0)(0)(0) or ForceRightTrigger=(0)(0)(0)

  * When using Machine, there are 6 different values that goes into each parenthesis.
    * `First: 0-8` `Second: 0-9` `Third: 0-7` `Fourth: 0-7` `Fifth: 0-255 NOT recomended to go over 40` `Sixth: 0-2 in Decimals, example: 0.1, 0.8, 1.0, 1.8, 2.0 etc...`
    * Example: ForceLeftTrigger=(0)(0)(0)(0)(0)(0) or ForceRightTrigger=(0)(0)(0)(0)(0)(0)
---
When using CustomTriggerValue, there are 17 different mode possibilites that are **CASE SENSITIVE** you can apply for:

CustomTriggerValueLeftMode= 

CustomTriggerValueRightMode= 

- `OFF`
- `Rigid`
- `Rigid A`
- `Rigid B`
- `Rigid AB`
- `Pulse`
- `Pulse A`
- `Pulse B`
- `Pulse AB`
- `VibrateResistance`
- `VibrateResistance A`
- `VibrateResistance B`
- `VibrateResistance AB`
- `Vibrate Pulse`
- `Vibrate Pulse A`
- `Vibrate Pulse B`
- `Vibrate Pulse AB`

```
LeftTrigger=GameCube
RightTrigger=AutomaticGun
ForceRightTrigger=(0)(8)(15)
```

`Note` : Best is to not leave spaces or extra unnecessary lines except for the lines you need to reduce the delay in reading the text file.

You can mix and match between states to get the desired effect for your game.

From previous testing, I believe you can write to a text file every frame, as the App will only read from that file.

For best results, I recommend you include the batch file with your game and have it execute when loading your game, which is explained below.

## **Batch File:**
This batch file will open the DualSenseX App and auto connect to the controller, and begin applying the trigger states from the text file.

To get started, download the zip file from above and attach the .Bat file in the directory of your game.
Edit the batch file according to your Game Title and the name of the text file that your game will write to.

Upon launching the game, you should execute this batch file, which will open a new window
of DualSenseX that takes in 2 paramaters from the batch file explained below and inside the batch file:

Both the batch file and the text file must be in the same directory with your game, the batch file gets the location of the 
text file depending on where the batch file is located.

- Replace `GAMENAME` with your Game Title.
- Replace `TEXTFILENAME.txt` with your text file name, while also including the .txt extension at the end
